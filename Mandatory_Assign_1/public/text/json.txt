    <li> JSON is a specification for javaScript object notation. <br><br>
    <li> JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data. <br><br>
    <li> JSON files are created with file.json. I't must contain curly brackets {...} to be valid and must use quotation marks " " for keys that you do not use in JavaScript.
</ul>

When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text.
JSON is text, and we can convert any JavaScript object into JSON, and send JSON to the server.
We can also convert any JSON received from the server into JavaScript objects.

Contains keys (ex. "firstname") and values (ex. "mads") like the example below:
<br><br>

This is our package.json which is a JSON file and contains all the information about our project and dependencies. 
<br><br>

The JSON file must also not contain duplicates:
<br><br>

A JSON file can also have nested keys (medical) like the example below.
