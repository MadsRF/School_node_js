JavaScript is the Programming Language for the Web. JavaScript can update and change both HTML and CSS. 
But for that we're primarly using jQuery which is a javaScript library 
In javaScript you find the same datatypes as we have worked with in Java. 
But we declare them diffrently like shown below from our exercises. 
Instead of using our datatypes like String, int, double or boolean to declare the type we use the value instead. 
this makes for a more dynamic use of our variables and easier to spot the type. 
we use the keywords "var", "let", "const". "var" is used for a global varible whereas the "let" is used 
for more local use like in a function or such. 
the "const" keyword is used for a variable that dosen't change type/value and staying what it was originally.

This first image is of 2 String values. This is seen by the quotation marks "String" which incapsulates our values 
<br><br>
<img src="/images/type1.jpg" alt="String"><br><br>

This one displays an object. Which is displayed with curly brackets {Object}
<br><br>
<img src="/images/type2.jpg" alt="object"><br><br>
This one is an Array which is displayed with square bracktes [Array]
<br><br>
<img src="/images/type3.jpg" alt="array"><br><br>
This one displays and String (year) and int (number) value. the int value must be a number 0-9 and without quotation marks. 
<br><br>
<img src="/images/type4.jpg" alt="string and int"><br><br>
This last one is an Array which holds multiple Objects with each multiple values.
