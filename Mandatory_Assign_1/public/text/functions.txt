A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.
For example, the following JavaScript code defines some simple functions:

<br><br>
<img src="/images/function1.jpg" alt="1"><br><br>
An arrow function expression has a shorter syntax compared to function expressions and does not have its own this, arguments, super, or new.target.
Two factors influenced the introduction of arrow functions: shorter functions and non-binding of this. See jQuery example below
<br><br>
<img src="/images/function2.jpg" alt="4"><br><br>
