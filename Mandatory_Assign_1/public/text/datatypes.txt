In javaScript you find the same datatypes as we have worked with in Java. But we declare them diffrently like shown below from our exercises. 

Instead of using our datatypes like String, int, double or boolean to declare the type we use the value instead. 

this makes for a more dynamic use of our variables and easier to spot the type. 

we use the keywords var, let, const. var is used for a global varible whereas the let is used for more local use like in a method or such. 

the const keyword is used for a variable that dosen't change type keeping it whatever it was originally.
