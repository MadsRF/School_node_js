A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.

This example below shows us how we do that with either our collection or one item/object 

<br><br>

We have done this in class with our car object. The first 2 functions is get all cars (the collection) and the other is the on specific car (item)
<br><br>
<img src="/images/rest2.jpg" alt="1"><br><br>

If we then start up our server and go to the GET item we see the following.
This is done by our path variabel which is 1 and points to our id.   

<br><br>

The same is done here but instead we don't point at a specific id but the whole collection of cars
<br><br>

This code snippet below shows our Create, Update and Delete function in our REST api. for our cars.
<br><br>

To manipulate/add to the server we use postman which allows us to do so.
In this image we use our create function and add a new object with key "price"
and value "it works" to our collection. We do this by sending a http post request because we want to add information to our list.
<br><br>

If we look at our collection again we see that it have been added.
<br><br>
<img src="/images/post3.jpg" alt="1"><br><br>
After that we use our delete function t oremove it from our collection again. We do this by 
pointing at the path variable which in this case would be 3.
<br><br>

Lastly we Update our collection by and using our path variabel and adding the keys and values we want to add in a json format
and as seen below we can see that our mercedes is now a jeep with a type of suv. But the id is still the same 
and thats because we don't allow our user to change that in our code by removing that option.
